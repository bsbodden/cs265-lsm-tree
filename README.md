# LSM Tree Database (Rust Implementation)

This repository contains a Rust implementation of an LSM tree key-value store, following the specifications from Harvard's CS265 Systems project. The implementation provides a client-server architecture for managing key-value data using a Log-Structured Merge Tree.

## Prerequisites

### Rust Installation

You'll need Rust installed on your system. If you haven't installed Rust yet, see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for installation options

The project requires Rust 1.81.0 or later.

## Building the Project

Clone the repository and build using cargo:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd lsm-tree
cargo build --release
```

## Running the Server

To launch the server:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin server [OPTIONS]
```

### Server Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-e <error_rate>` | 0.01 | Bloom filter error rate |
| `-n <num_pages>` | 1024 | Size of the buffer by number of disk pages |
| `-f <fanout>` | 2 | LSM tree fanout |
| `-l <level_policy>` | "leveled" | Compaction policy (options: tiered, leveled, lazy_leveled, partial) |
| `-p <port>` | 8080 | Port number |
| `-h` | N/A | Print help message |

## Running the Client

To launch the client:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin client [OPTIONS]
```

### Client Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p <port>` | Port number (default: 8080) |
| `-q` | Quiet mode |

## Supported Commands

The database supports the following commands:

### Client Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `p <key> <value>` | Put a key-value pair | `p 10 42` |
| `g <key>` | Get value for key | `g 10` |
| `r <start> <end>` | Range query | `r 10 20` |
| `d <key>` | Delete key | `d 10` |
| `l <filename>` | Load from file | `l "data.bin"` |
| `s` | Print stats | `s` |
| `q` | Quit | `q` |

### Server Commands

While the server is running, you can enter these commands in the server terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bloom` | Print Bloom Filter summary |
| `quit` | Quit server |
| `help` | Print help message |

## Development Status

This is an initial implementation focusing on the basic client-server architecture and command processing. Future updates will include:

- Full LSM tree implementation
- Bloom filter optimization
- Compaction strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Multi-threading support
